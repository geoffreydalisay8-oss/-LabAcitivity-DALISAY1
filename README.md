This program demonstrates The LCM (Least Common Multiple) of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is evenly divisible by both numbers.

Write a program that will ask the user to input two (2) integer values and will compute the LCM using Python recursion (or using a recursive helper that uses gcd). 
and Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where it consists of three rods and n disks. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

Only one disk can be moved at a time.
Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack (a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack).
No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
A, B, C are the name of rods. (Show moves for n disks as required by the problem.)
